This is a basic script to update mastercomfig instead of going on the website and manually downloading everything.

There are options for addons, presets, and all modules. In the `update.sh` file, you will find various variables for the preset(s), the addons, and the modules. Change the integer to the corresponding preset/addon(s)/module(s) you want installed.

I have only tested this on Arch
